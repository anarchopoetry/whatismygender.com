Gender Generator
by anarchopoetry

the intent here is not to make fun of non-binary genders; it is to point out the arbitrarity of gender assignment. i am a surrealist; as such, i believe every single one of these genders literally exists, and that chance contains cosmic truth. don't hate what you don't understand! (whether that is surrealism or non-binary gender).

i do not care what you do with this code! i literally could not care less. use it, reuse it, subvert it, sell it, print it out, ball it up and throw it at republicans. it makes no difference to me! just don't be a dick, k? thx!!
